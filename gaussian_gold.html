        		<h1>The Gaussian Gold Miner</h1>
			  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Your Backstory and the Problem</h2>
			
				<p><img src="../images/miner_family.jpg" style="width:630;height:400px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
        
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The year is 1852, and California's Gold Rush is at its absolute peak. 
				As a prospective miner, you have recently moved out west to get your fill and strike it rich. Upon arriving in town, 
				you are disheartened to realize that you are one of the last ones to arrive, and therefore you are given one of the worst 
				plots of land to dig on. It is a long, scorching hot ravine that stretches just about a mile. The rocks you will be digging 
				through to find your gold are incredibly tough to break, and each hole you dig takes about a week to finish, at which point 
				you are able to determine the amount of gold in that specific location, and choose whether to dig deeper to collect more of it, 
				or move on to a search in a new location. The initial hole that you dig is 100% predictive of how much gold lies below in that 
				specific region, so if your initial hole contains no gold, digging deeper will still yield nothing, and if that initial hole contains 
				13 ounces of gold, digging a hole in that exact same spot of the same size just deeper will produce for you another 13 ounces, and so 
				on. Miners call this a "gold pocket".</p>
			
				<p><img src="../images/desert_ravine.jpg" style="width:666;height:500px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
        
				<p style="text-align:left;"> At sunrise you make the trip out to the ravine with the man who is leasing you the land. He shows you the 
				land you will be mining, as well as two large holes, one at the entrance and one at the exit of the ravine. He says both of these were 
				dug by a pair of miners earlier in the month. The plan had been for each miner to start at a separate end of the ravine, and work their 
				way through until they met in the middle, becoming rich with the gold they found along the way. The only problem was that after a week 
				of digging in the scorching sun, and each miner having only made a single hole, and both the holes having yielded absolutely zero ounces 
				of gold, the pair decided that the ravine wasn't worth the work it took to mine, and packed up to seach elsewhere. Word got out about the 
				difficult plot of land, which is why it was all that was left when you were the last one to show up. Since this ravine will be incredibly 
				time consuming to mine, you have to find a way to find the location that contains the maximum amount of gold. Once you have found this 
				location, you can dig deeper and deeper in this spot to collect the most gold possible!</p>
        
        		<h3>The Layout</h3>
        
       				<p style="text-align:left;">Below is a graph that shows the true amount of gold per hole at each specific area 
				along the one mile ravine. If you were to dig one hole after another consecutively from the start of the ravine to
				the end, plotting how far into the ravine that you are with the amount of gold you found in your hole, this is the 
				graph that you would come up with. Unfortunately for you, digging that many holes would be impossible for one person
				and you do not have the resources, time, or money to accomplish such a feat, therefore you are not privy to this true function
				that relates distance in the ravine to gold density.</p>
			
				<p><img src="../images/Gold_True_Function_1.jpg" style="width:717;height:350px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			
				<p style="text-align:left;">In order to solve this problem, you decide to dig 4 holes randomly spaced throughout the 
				ravine, see how much gold is in each, and then go from there. This takes a month to accomplish, but will certainly be 
				worth the work. Below are the results of the data that you collected from the 4 holes that you dug. Remember, cannot see
				the red true function, it is only there as a reference for the omniscient reader.</p>
        
				<p><img src="../images/Gold_True_Function.jpg" style="width:700;height:350px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			
				<p style="text-align:left;">At this point you are able to seperate yourself from the other miners that came before you. While
				the average miner might decide to stake his claim and start digging roughly 0.13 miles into the ravine, the place where the most 
				gold was found out of the 4 holes that were dug, you decide to take a different approach. You use your data to construct a 
				Gaussian Process in order to better understand what parts of the ravine are worth exploring farther, before you set up shop and 
				commit to digging in one specific area. This produces the graph shown below.</p>
				
				<p><img src="../images/GP_First_Dig.jpg" style="width:686;height:350px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			
				<p style="text-align:left;">Based on the results of your model, you determine that there is still quite a bit of area left
				to search in the ravine where there is a chance that there might be more gold per hole dug. This is shown by the shaded 
				region on the graph. Since your model says that at 0.62 miles into the ravine you have the highest chance of finding an area
				to mine with a greater gold density per hole than your current best spot, you decide to dig another hole there.</p>
			
				<p><img src="../images/GP_Second_Dig.jpg" style="width:700;height:350px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			
				<p style="text-align:left;">Sucess! Your new location yielded far more gold per hole dug than your previous maximum, so 
				the search was worth it. You run the Gaussian Process again, this time with a new data point and a new maximum. As you
				can see from the graph above, the shaded region of possible locations that are better than where you currently are has 
				gotten significantly smaller. You look at the graph, and decide the next best place to look is at 0.57 miles into the ravine
				since there is a chance that this area will contain a higher gold density than your current location.</p>
			
				<p><img src="../images/GP_Third_Dig.jpg" style="width:706;height:350px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			
				<p style="text-align:left;">Sucess!...Again! This time there is no where left to search, since the shaded region is the
				only place left that is greater than your current maximum, and the Gaussian Process does not believe the there is any chance
				that the true function exists in this region. You set up your camp and your mine here, and start digging. After only
				a month of prep work (4 random holes dug) and two weeks of searching (2 holes dug), you have found the best possible 
				place to dig with the least amount of work, and proceed to strike it rich.</p>
