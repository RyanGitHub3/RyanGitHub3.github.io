        		<h1>The Heat Equation</h1>

			<h2 style="text-align:center;">Comparing Numerical Solutions To The Heat Equation</h2>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Main Idea</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The aim of this project is to test three different numerical methods that can be
					used in order to solve the heat equation, and observe the efficiency and stability of each. These methods are
					the forward euler, backward euler, and crank-nicholson methods.</p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Problem Statement</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The time step size for this problem will be k=0.01, and the mesh step size will be
					h=0.02. We will observe the equation after 1 second in time has passed. We begin with the initial boundary 
					value problem of the heat equation written as ut(t, x) − uxx(t, x) = 0. Our problem specific case will be 
					represented as u(0, x) = e^−100x^2, where u(−1, t) = u(1, t) = 0.</p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Forward Euler</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> Plotted below in the first graph are 100 realizations of the heat equation as it passes 
					through time going from 0 seconds to 1 seconds with step size k=0.01. The second plot shows the equation when 
					the time is exactly 1 second. We can see that this method is extremely unstable, as we are getting an answer 
					just shy of 1e182, which is massive.</p>

				<p><img src="../images/ForwardEuler_Second.jpg" style="width:783px;height:400px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Backward Euler</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> Plotted below in the first graph are 100 realizations of the heat equation as it passes 
					through time going from 0 seconds to 1 seconds with step size k=0.01. The second plot shows the equation when 
					the time is exactly 1 second. We can see that this method is extremely stable, since we move from the our initial
					starting point (the blue curve in the first graph) that has a high temparature, down to a temperature of almost zero
					as time passes and our system cools off. This cooled off system, when time is equal to 1 second, can be seen in 
					the second graph (also a blue curve).</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Crank-Nicolson Method</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> Plotted below in the first graph are 100 realizations of the heat equation as it passes 
					through time going from 0 seconds to 1 seconds with step size k=0.01. The second plot shows the equation when 
					the time is exactly 1 second. Much like the Backward Euler method, the Crank-Nicholson method is also stable.
					We can see how the curves "cool off" and decrease in temperature (as show by going from the blue to orange
					to green to red curves and so on).</p>
				<p><img src="../images/Crank_First.jpg" style="width:788px;height:400px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
				<p><img src="../images/Crank_Second.jpg" style="width:746px;height:370px;/"  align="middle" ></p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Concluding Statements & Analysis of Findings</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The most important thing to understand about the results of the graphs above is that	
					the backwards Euler Method as well as Crank Nicolson Method are unconditionally stable, which is why we are 
					able to observe them converging to approximate some solution when k=0.01. The forwards Euler Method on the other 
					hand, is only stable when (k/h^2) < 0.5. This only occurs around k = 0.0001, which would yield 0.25 < 0.5. Since
					k=0.01, our stability equation produces (0.01/0.02^2)=25 which is not less than 0.5.
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">*I applied this same idea to various step sizes of "k" to each of these three methods, and got some 	
					really fascinating looking graphs and results. The full project with all the code can be viewed on my GitHub, 
					link below.*</h3>
