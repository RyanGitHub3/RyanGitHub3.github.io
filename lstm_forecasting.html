			<h2 style="text-align:center;">Forecasting Daily Stock Prices Using an LSTM Neural Network</h2>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Main Idea</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					The focus of this project was to see just how accurate LSTM Neural Networks are when trying to predict daily
					future stock prices. Aside from recent developments with Transformer Neural Networks, the LSTM Neural Network
					is one of the most reliable neural networks out there, and far superiour to the vanilla RNNs from the days of 
					old, due to LSTM's ability to solve the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.</p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Set Up</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					This model was trained on roughly 4 years worth of AAPL stock price data, and aims to predict the daily
					prices of the next year. It does not predict the whole years worth of prices all at once, rather it looks
					backwards 21 days prior, and uses this data in order to predict the 22nd day. It does this again with days
					2-22 in order to predict day 23, and so on and so forth. So each prediction is only a single day ahead, and we
					do this over the course of a year. When the model predicts tomorrow's closing price
					will be lower than today, and we already own the stock, it sells, and when tomorrow's predicted price 
					is higher than today, and we already own the stock, the model will hold. When we don't own the stock, a forecast
					of a lower price makes the model stand pat, and a forecast of a higher price executes a buy order.</p>
			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Selecting Hyperparameters</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					In order to choose the correct number of epochs, batchsize, and units for optimal accuracy while still
					saving computational time, I elected to use Bayesian Optimization. This method leverages a Gaussian Process
					in order to optimally explore areas where a maximum is likely to occur, so we do not have to waste time grid
					searching, or do random selection. The selections the model made for batchsize, epochs, and units are laid out
					in the image below.</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					Below is the graphical output of our LSTM Neural Network when tested on a year of 
					data that it has not seen. The model performs pretty well, and seems to fit the trend of 
					the true AAPL stock price movement.</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					Below is the profit of the model using the LSTM Neural Network when compared to the standard buy and hold
					strategy over the course of the year. The green line is the model, and the blue line is the stock.
					The model found success by avoiding large dips in price by holding when times were bad, and then quickly buying
					back into the stock when an upward trend was once again realized.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Closing Remarks</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> 
					Neural Network training is fairly complicated with a high degree of room for adjustments and modifications
					that can drastically improve model accuracy. I would like to explore this idea much more in the future, and 
					possibly see if more success can be found tuning seperate hyperparameters, using different stocks as data sets,
					and different styles of training the data.
