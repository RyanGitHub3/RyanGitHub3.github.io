				<h3>Your Backstory and the Problem</h3>
        
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The year is 1852, and California's Gold Rush is at its absolute peak. 
        As a prospective miner, you have recently moved out west to get your fill and strike it rich. Upon arriving in town, 
        you are disheartened to realize that you are one of the last ones to arrive, and therefore you are given one of the worst 
        plots of land to dig on. It is a long, scorching hot ravine that stretches just about a mile. The rocks you will be digging 
        through to find your gold are incredibly tough to break, and each hole you dig takes about a week to finish, at which point 
        you are able to determine the amount of gold in that specific location, and choose whether to dig deeper to collect more of it, 
        or move on to a search in a new location. The initial hole that you dig is 100% predictive of how much gold lies below in that 
        specific region, so if your initial hole contains no gold, digging deeper will still yield nothing, and if that initial hole contains 
        13 ounces of gold, digging a hole in that exact same spot of the same size just deeper will produce for you another 13 ounces, and so 
        on. Miners call this a "gold pocket".</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;"> At sunrise you make the trip out to the ravine with the man who is leasing you the land. He shows you the 
        land you will be mining, as well as two large holes, one at the entrance and one at the exit of the ravine. He says both of these were 
        dug by a pair of miners earlier in the month. The plan had been for each miner to start at a separate end of the ravine, and work their 
        way through until they met in the middle, becoming rich with the gold they found along the way. The only problem was that after a week 
        of digging in the scorching sun, and each miner having only made a single hole, and both the holes having yielded absolutely zero ounces 
        of gold, the pair decided that the ravine wasn't worth the work it took to mine, and packed up to seach elsewhere. Word got out about the 
        difficult plot of land, which is why it was all that was left when you were the last one to show up. Since this ravine will be incredibly 
        time consuming to mine, you have to find a way to find the location that contains the maximum amount of gold. Once you have found this 
        location, you can dig deeper and deeper in this spot to collect the most gold possible!</p>
        
        <h3>The Layout</h3>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;">Below is a graph that shows the amount of gold per hole dug at each specific area along the one mile ravine. 
        Unfortunately for you, you are not privy to this information.</p>
